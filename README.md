**SPOOFY!!**

I created this tool during an external penetration test with a scope limited to only o365.

This tool was built on the shoulders of giants...

Shoutz to Black Hills Information Security for their research on Direct Send.

Somehow someway the scope of what was mentioned in their blog has changed, now you can use any o365 account to spoof ANY user to ANY domain (within the msft ecosystem) - FUN STUFF RIGHT?!

This tool is only to be used with explicit permission from the sending domain. I am not liable for any of your shenanigans...

Lots of cool stuff built into this, you can specify the rhost, attachments, sender address, recipient file (emails one per line), ect. Im done for today Cheers!

-------Update-------
Today is 10/11/2024

I have submitted the issue to Microsoft, due to the general lack of acknowledgement of the issue, I've decided to release this tool to the public.

Enjoy!
